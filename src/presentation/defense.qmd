# Introduction

## Motivation

::: {.fragment}
- How to **distribute value** is a fundamental question in economics
  - Wage bargaining
  - Sharing the costs of a road trip
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Many of such situations are characterized by an **imbalance of power**
  - Employer vs. employees
  - Driver vs. passengers
:::

::: {.fragment}
- The **one indispensable / many smaller plyers** is an economically important special case
:::


## History

::: {.fragment}
- Bargaining theory has a long history in economics
  - @zeuthen1930problems, @hicks1932theory
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Cooperative (or axiomatic) bargaining theory in the 1950s
  - Seminal paper: @nash1950bargaining
  - More general cooperative game theory: @shapley1953value, @gillies1959solutions
:::

::: {.fragment}
- The Nash-program: non-cooperative microfoundations [@nash1953two]
  - Most well-known is @rubinstein1982perfect, @harsanyi1956approaches is an early example
  - Microfoundations for the Shapley value: @gul1989bargaining, @winter1994demand, @hart1996bargaining, @stole1996intra

## This thesis

::: {.fragment}
- Focus on the case of
  - Predictions from **cooperative game theory**
  - **One** (few) **central player**(s) and many smaller ones
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Three aspects
  - A general, **abstract** treatment of the problem
  - An application to **hybrid platforms**
  - A **lab experiment** to get a better understanding of bargaining behavior

# Cooperative game theory

## Coalitional form games

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- A game $\mathcal{G} = (N, v)$ consists of
  - A set of **players** $N$
  - A **characteristic function** $v: 2^N \to \mathbb{R}$

::: {.fragment}
- Example 3-player game
  - Two producers ($A_1, A_2$): can each make \$1 on their own
  - A platform: ($P$): triples the firms' profits
:::

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="40%" .smaller}

Players: $$N = \{P, A_1, A_2\}$$

Characteristic function $v(S)$:

Coalition ($S$) | Profits
----------|---------:
$\{P\}$     |  0
$\{A_i\}$   | 1
$\{A_1, A_2\}$  | 2
$\{P, A_i\}$  | 3
$\{P, A_1, A_2\}$  | 6
:::

::: {.notes}
 - Two ingredients: players (left) and characteristic function (right)
 - We don't care about strategies, only about value achieved by coalitions

## The Shapley-value

:::: {.columns}

## Why do we care about it?

Same idea as with the Nash bargaining solution

 - Axiomatic reasoning
    - The Shapley-value is the only sharing rule that satisfies a nice set of axioms: efficiency, symmetry, linearity, dummy player axiom [@shapley1953additive]
 - Bargaining foundations
    - The value arises as the subgame-perfect equilibrium of various alternating-offer bargaining games [e.g. @gul1989bargaining; @winter1994demand; @hart1996bargaining; @stole1996intra; @inderst2003bargaining]
 - A tractable and sensible-looking gain-sharing rule
    - Comparative statics show that it behaves as one would expect

::: {.notes}
 - You don't need to think about cooperative game theory in the following part
 - Think of it as a convenient gain sharing rule with some (cooperative and non-cooperative) micro-foundations

## Motivation

::: {.fragment}
- Much work on bargaining in experimental economics (understatement)
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Much less work on **free-form bargaining**
  - especially between **more than two players**
:::
::: {.fragment}
- The **one indispensable player / multiple small players** setting has real-world relevance
  - Wage bargaining
  - An inventor with an idea and multiple investors
  - A band, where one member owns the PA system
:::

::: {.notes}
 - Need some asymmetry for interesting bargaining outcomes
 - One player being indispensable is
   - Natural
   - Maximally asymmetrix → stronger effect
:::


## Research question

::: {.fragment}
- Problem: non-cooperative game theory cannot provide predictions without structure
  - E.g. timing of the game, who makes the offers
  - NCGT solution is alternating offer games, but a lot depends on minor details [@hart1996bargaining]
:::

::: {.highlight-block .fragment}
- How does bargaining power affect bargaining outcomes?
- How well do cooperative game theory solution concepts describe the outcomes?
:::

::: {.notes}
- Bargaining power ~ how important it is to have all small players on board (see later)
:::


## What we do

::: {.fragment}
- **Free-form bargaining between three players**
  - Almost no structure
  - Group-level unrestricted **chat**
  - An interface for proposing and accepting allocations
  - No binding decision until the very last second
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Vary the bargaining power of the indispensable player
  - How important it is to have all small players on board
:::

::: {.fragment}
- We test, whether:
  - Outcomes vary as we would expect, based on bargaining power
  - Certain CGT solution concepts provide good predictions
:::

::: {.notes}
- Everything before the final seconds is cheap talk
- What the big player and one small player can achieve on their own
- Also, lots of data for exploratory analysis
:::


## Literature
:::: {.smaller}
::: {.fragment}
- Early unstructured bargaining papers (1950s-1990s):  
  - E.g. @Kalischetal1952, @Maschler1965, @NydeggerOwen1974, @RapoportKahan1976, **@MurnighanRoth1977**, @MurnighanRoth1978, @Micheneretal1979, @MichenerPotter1981, **@LeopoldWildburger1992** 
  - Face to face bargaining, different experimental standards
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Free-form bargaining
  - E.g. @Galeottietal2018, @HossainLyonsSiow2020, **@NavarroVeszteg2020**
  - Almost always bilateral
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Multi-lateral bargaining
  - E.g. @MonteroSeftonZhang2008, @MitsutsuneTakanori2014, @TremewanVanberg2016, @chessa2023experiment, **@ShinodaFunaki2022**
  - Structured or semi-structured
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Fairness views in bargaining
  - E.g. @LuhanPoulsenRoos2019, @Schwaninger2022, **@ClippelRozen2022**
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
- @MurnighanRoth1977: shoes game ($Y=0$); series of papers: information and communication structure are important
- @LeopoldWildburger1992: face to face, very long rounds, convex comb. of N + ES or SV + ES
- @NavarroVeszteg2020: bilateral, chat, tests axioms (rejets scale invariance)
- @ShinodaFunaki2022: chat in some treatments, semi-unstructured; how existence of core affects outcomes
- @ClippelRozen2022: outside party assigns payoffs, SV + ES
:::


## The game

::: {.fragment}
- **Players**: $N = \{A, B_1, B_2\}$
:::
::: {.fragment}
- **Value function**: $v: 2^N \to \mathbb{R}$
  - No one can create any value alone: $v(\{A\}) = v(\{B_i\}) = 0$
  - Player $A$ is indispensable: $v(\{B_1, B_2\}) = 0$
  - Small players contribute to the value: $v(\{A, B_i\}) = Y \in [0, 100]$
  - The more small players the better: $v(\{A, B_1, B_2\}) = 100$
:::

::: {.highlight-block .fragment}
How to divide the value between the players?
:::

::: {.notes}
- No need to define strategy spaces, only players plus payoffs
- It "makes sense" for the grand coalition to form (but wait for results)
:::


## Solution concepts
![](/out/figures/values_theory.svg)

::: {.notes}
- Both are increasing in Y
  - Nucleolus is flat for low Y (no real bargaiing power)
  - SV predictions are less extreme
- Core would contain ES for Y < 67
:::


## Experimental setup

::: {.fragment}
- **4 treatments/sessions** and **144 subjects**
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Timing: 
  - Instructions with comprehension checks
  - Slider task
  - Trial round + 5 bargaining rounds (5 minutes each)
  - Survey (demographics, reasoning, axioms)
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Free-form bargaining via **public chat** and interface for submitting **proposals** and current **acceptances**
  - Unlimited number of messages and proposals 
  - Acceptances are **not binding** and can be changed any time
:::

::: {.notes}
- Have to solve tasks on a mock interface to proceed
- Slider task to make the bargaining position feel earned
- Slider task performance not disclosed
:::


## Main results: average payoffs
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](/out/figures/payoff_average_rounds_all.svg){width=100% height=100%}
:::

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller .fragment}
- Dummy player gets something
- $Y=10$ and $Y=30$ treatments look similar
- Player A gets more in $Y=30$ treatment
- Nucleolus better in terms of 'shape' but worse in terms of 'distance'
- Linear regression and Mann-Whitney test yield the same conclusion
:::

::::


## A deeper look {#sec-by-agreement}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](/out/figures/payoff_by_agreement_type_rounds_all.svg){width=100% height=100%}
:::

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller .fragment}
- In all treatments, equal(ish) split is a frequent outcome
  - Even in the dummy player treatment!
- $Y=10$ and $Y=30$ treatments still look similar
- In the $Y=90$ treatment
  - $A$ only achieves significantly higher by excluding one small player (@sec-timing)
  - Neither efficient nor stable
:::

::::


## Testing the axioms {#sec-axioms}

::: {.fragment}
- Axioms charactetrizing the Shapley value and the core
  - Look at observed **behavior**
  - **Survey** at the end of the experiment
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Observed choices provide
  - Strong evidence **against dummy player and stability** axiom
  - Evidence **against symmetry and efficiency** axioms in **$Y=90$** groups
  - Evidence **for symmetry and efficiency** axioms in **other treatments**
  - Some evidence **against linearity**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- **Stated preferences and actions disagree**
  - Concerns about subjects understanding the questions
:::

::: {.crossref}
Details: @sec-axioms-appendix

## Chat topics (before final agreement) #{#sec-chat-topics}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](/out/figures/chat_topics_until_agreement.svg){width=100% height=100%}
:::

:::{.column width="35%" .smaller .fragment}
- Lots of **small talk**
  - Early agreement → **boredom**
  - **Negotiation** tactic for small players
- Relatively **few fairness-related arguments**
  - Although **more** in treatments **with high bargaining power disparity**
- Discussion **about the experiment** itself
  - Players can clarify the rules for others
  - Provides feeddback for the experimenters
:::

## Main takeaways

::: {.fragment}
- Lots of **equal splits** in all treatments, but considerable **heterogeneity**
  - Heterogeneity in fairness concepts?
  - Norms established in early rounds?
:::
::: {.fragment}
- **Nucleolus** gives **qualitatively correct** predictions
  - No bargaining power advantage when there is no profitable deviation
:::
::: {.fragment}
- Both **overestimate big player's share**
  - They do not capture all relevant fairness considerations
  - Combining other-regarding preferences and CGT might be promising
:::
::: {.fragment}
- People's stated **preferences and actions disagree**
:::

::: {.notes}
- In general, considerable heterogeneity in outcomes
  - Heterogeneity in fairness concepts?
