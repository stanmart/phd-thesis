# Introduction

## Motivation

::: {.fragment}
- How to **distribute value** is a fundamental question in economics
  - Wage bargaining
  - Sharing the costs of a road trip
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Many of such situations are characterized by an **imbalance of power**
  - Employer vs. employees
  - Driver vs. passengers
:::

::: {.fragment}
- The **one indispensable / many smaller plyers** is an economically important special case
:::


## History

::: {.fragment}
- Bargaining theory has a long history in economics
  - @zeuthen1930problems, @hicks1932theory
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Cooperative (or axiomatic) bargaining theory in the 1950s
  - Seminal paper: @nash1950bargaining
  - More general cooperative game theory: @shapley1953value, @gillies1959solutions
:::

::: {.fragment}
- The Nash-program: non-cooperative microfoundations [@nash1953two]
  - Most well-known is @rubinstein1982perfect, @harsanyi1956approaches is an early example
  - Microfoundations for the Shapley value: @gul1989bargaining, @winter1994demand, @hart1996bargaining, @stole1996intra
:::


## This thesis

::: {.fragment}
- Focus on the case of
  - Predictions from **cooperative game theory**
  - **One** (few) **central player**(s) and many smaller ones
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Three aspects
  - A general, **abstract** treatment of the problem
  - An application to **hybrid platforms**
  - A **lab experiment** to get a better understanding of bargaining behavior

# Cooperative game theory

## Coalitional form games

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- A game $\mathcal{G} = (N, v)$ consists of
  - A set of **players** $N$
  - A **characteristic function** $v: 2^N \to \mathbb{R}$

::: {.fragment}
- Example 3-player game
  - Two producers ($A_1, A_2$): can each make \$1 on their own
  - A platform: ($P$): triples the firms' profits
:::

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="40%" .smaller}

Players: $$N = \{P, A_1, A_2\}$$

Characteristic function $v(S)$:

Coalition ($S$) | Profits
----------|---------:
$\{P\}$     |  0
$\{A_i\}$   | 1
$\{A_1, A_2\}$  | 2
$\{P, A_i\}$  | 3
$\{P, A_1, A_2\}$  | 6
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
 - Two ingredients: players (left) and characteristic function (right)
 - We don't care about strategies, only about value achieved by coalitions
:::


## The Shapley-value

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Each player gets their **expected marginal contribution**

## Why do we care about it?

Same idea as with the Nash bargaining solution

 - Axiomatic reasoning
    - The Shapley-value is the only sharing rule that satisfies a nice set of axioms: efficiency, symmetry, linearity, dummy player axiom [@shapley1953additive]
 - Bargaining foundations
    - The value arises as the subgame-perfect equilibrium of various alternating-offer bargaining games [e.g. @gul1989bargaining; @winter1994demand; @hart1996bargaining; @stole1996intra; @inderst2003bargaining]
 - A tractable and sensible-looking gain-sharing rule
    - Comparative statics show that it behaves as one would expect

::: {.notes}
 - You don't need to think about cooperative game theory in the following part
 - Think of it as a convenient gain sharing rule with some (cooperative and non-cooperative) micro-foundations
